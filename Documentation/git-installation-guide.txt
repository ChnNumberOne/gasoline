Installing Git Guide
If you already have a local repository delete it ( there is nothing in it anyways its easier / if you have important data just copy it somewhere else where you
know it doesnt belong into the repo.)

1. find or create a online git repository.
2. install the Git Extension in Visual Studio under:
Tools -> Extensions and Updates -> Online tab on the left-> GitHub Extension for VisualStudio
3. Go to Visual Studio Team Explorer
4. Under GitHub connect and Clone your Project from github
5. In our case select the Organisations gasoline Project and select a local path for the local repository
